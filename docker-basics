Docker is a containeration platform that provides easy way to containerize your application which means using docker



Installed docker and run below command to add user 
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER


whatever we want to run a application all the dependencies, code, package and all supplies in docker image.
container is the running instance of image.
docker ps ->checks the running containers
docker images ->displays the images available in server.
docker pull <image-name> -> pulls the image from docker repository/hub.
docker pull nginx -> it pulls latest verison from docker hub
docker images -> here u can see docker image 
docker pull nginx:mainline-alpine3.23-perl   -> mainline-alpine3.23-perl this is tag if you want particular version copy the tag in docker hub.
docker pull nginx:alpine-slim -> it creates a alpine-slim image.
Now i want to run container so will create container from image  -> docker create <image name>:version -> docker create nginx:alpine-slim.
docker ps -> here it is not showing container so -> docker ps -a -> here container is not running -> docker start <container ID>  -> it starts the container.
docker stop <container ID>, docker rm <container ID>  -> remove container
docker rm -f <container ID> -> it deletes running container
docker images -> if you want to delete docker images -> docker rmi <image ID> -> this will not delete running container so use docker rmi -f <imageID> -> it deletes forcefully
docker run= docker pull + create + start => docker run nginx -> it is running foreground, it occupies the screen so will run background => docker run -d nginx
Nginx is running inside the container how can we access in the browser, so we have VM inside VM we hvae container inside container docker engine and host have post and container have port we have to give port no. and connect in browser.
docker run -d -p <host-port>:<container-port> => docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx, now open in browser with IP, http://IP
container is like a nano server, if you want to open a terminal -> docker exec -it <container-ID> bash -> opens the terminal
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
vi index.html -> here vi is not working so rm -rf index.html -> echo "<h1>Hi, I am from container </h1>" > index.html
open in browser -> http://IP, o/p: i am from a container
docker inspect <container-ID>   -> it gives info about container
docker logs <container-ID>  -> it shows logs of container

Here Name it is taking container name randomly, see the last column name focused-meither, if you want to change to particular name  => docker run -d -p 80:80 --name docker-practice nginx
deepika@nginx:~$ docker ps

Docker File:
Docker file is used to build custom image. we can make use of docker instructions to create a docker images.

FROM RUN CRM ENTRYPOINT COPY ADD ENV ARG WORKDIR USER

FROM
------------------------------------------------------------------------
From should be the 1st instruction in docker file. It represents base OS. There is an exception ARG.
min OS+application runtime+dependencies+package+code =Image
RHEL 9 is high memory RHEL is VM OS. so we choose almalinux it is same as RHEL but if we get anu issue we will not get support from anyone
almalinux is equivalent to RHEL
How to build docker image?
 docker build -t imagename:version . => represents current build have dockerfile file  -t for tagging
docker build -t from:v1
