Docker is a containeration platform that provides easy way to containerize your application which means using docker 

whatever we want to run a application all the dependencies, code, package and all supplies in docker image.
container is the running instance of image.
docker ps ->checks the running containers
docker images ->displays the images available in server.
docker pull <image-name> -> pulls the image from docker repository/hub.
docker pull nginx -> it pulls latest verison from docker hub
docker images -> here u can see docker image 
docker pull nginx:mainline-alpine3.23-perl   -> mainline-alpine3.23-perl this is tag if you want particular version copy the tag in docker hub.
docker pull nginx:alpine-slim -> it creates a alpine-slim image.
Now i want to run container so will create container from image  -> docker create <image name>:version -> docker create nginx:alpine-slim.
docker ps -> here it is not showing container so -> docker ps -a -> here container is not running -> docker start <container ID>  -> it starts the container.
docker stop <container ID>, docker rm <container ID>  -> remove container
docker rm -f <container ID> -> it deletes running container
docker images -> if you want to delete docker images -> docker rmi <image ID>
docker run= docker pull + create + start => docker run nginx -> it is running foreground, it occupies the screen so will run background => docker run -d nginx
